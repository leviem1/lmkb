# Why Minecraft minigame servers ~don't work~ are *really* hard:

1) You have to find a server powerful enough to run all your minigames. Those cost $50/mo or $600/yr if you actually want something performant.

2) Servers like the Hive and Hyperlands are actually built from multiple servers so that they can handle their load, which is very hard to do. You need people who understand computer networking and system administration. You also need developers since not all plugins work with multiple servers.

3) Many of the minigame mods are developed by different people, so the different minigames and plugins tend to cause issues with each other. The more you have, the worse it gets. If you have mods that are causing issues, there's no guarantee the developer(s) will fix it.

4) The minigames that are free and work well tend to be quite popular, meaning a bunch of other servers probably have them too. It's hard to be "unique".

5) Minigame servers require >10 players to be on 24/7 otherwise there's not enough players to play the minigames with to keep it interesting.

6) Due to #4 and #5, players don't tend to donate much money. You need at least 5 players paying $10/mo just to cover server costs.
