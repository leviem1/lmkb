# Setting a global .gitignore

Setting a global .gitignore can be helpful to avoid adding the same ignores to every repository
for things like IDE files. You can create a global ignore which will apply to all repos you
access as your user.

Here's the command to do it:  
`git config --global core.excludesfile <filename>`
