# OpenJDK vs Oracle JDK Licensing

After Java 8, Oracle changed the terms in which it distributes its Java Development Kit (JDK).
Oracle has supported the OpenJDK project for years, which is distributed under the GNU GPLv2,
w/ Classpath Exception. Here are the primary differences between these distributions as of
Java 11.

| | OpenJDK | Oracle JDK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free for personal use? | Yes | Yes |
| Free for development use? | Yes | Yes |
| Free for commercial use? | Yes | **No** |
| Available at: | <https://jdk.java.net/> | <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html> |

There are many vendors in addition to Oracle that distribute their own implementation of the
OpenJDK. Support and production-readiness vary between vendors.

Some honorable mentions include:
- [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/)
- [Azul Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#download-openjdk)
